# House-Price-Prediction
By Linear Regression ML Model
Machine learning is a subset of AI.ML is having various categories i.e., supervised learning,unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.
In supervised learning when our target variable (TV)is numeric in nature Regression is used else Classification model we have to built for prediction.
In this particular problem we have to predict the price of a house on the basis of bedromm,area, and age of the buyer.
Since here our TV is numeric in nature we use Linear Regression for prediction.

Data collection: very small dataset created using pandas Dataset.

Data Cleaning:No Data cleaning/preprocessing is required.

Data Analysis and Data visualization is done.

Evaluation is also done using R2 value which is aso seems to be good

Finally Linear Regression model is created and evaluation of slope and intercept value is done for house price prediction.
